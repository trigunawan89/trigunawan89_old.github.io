I want to start blogging with GitHub Page & Jekyll. This blog is intended for my learning purpose. I want to share my experiment on python. My experience of programming was started 10 years ago when I was studying at college. My first programing language is C. I am very interested in what can we do with C as a compiler. Within that age, I have no idea about python, for sure that python is not as popular as now. In the last 5 years, python was increasing in popularity. A multipurpose language that we can deliver different projects from a web application, dev ops, embedded system until data science. I am very instered on the last one, yes data science. Although python is not intended for data analytics/ data science originally but with tons of library like numpy, pandas and scikit-learn python becomes very mature in this area. One of the best things of python is we can do almost everything in the world of programming. I am sorry if my article is not well written because it originally for my learning purpose.
