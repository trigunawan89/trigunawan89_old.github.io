I want to start blogging with GitHub Page & Jekyll. This blog is intended for my learning purpose. 

I want to share my experiment on python. My experience of programming was started ten years ago when I was studying at college. My first programing language is C. I am very interested in what can we do with C as a compiler. Within that age, I have no idea about python, for sure that python is not as popular as now. In the last seven years, python language was increasing in popularity. A multipurpose language that we can deliver different projects from a web application, dev ops, embedded system until data science. I am very interested in the last one, yap data science. Although python is not intended for data analytics/ data science formerly with tons of libraries like numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn python becomes very mature in this area. One of the best things about python is we can do almost everything in the world of programming. I am sorry if my article is not well written because it was for my learning purpose.
